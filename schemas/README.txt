This directory contains XML schemas and DTDs used by the Harctoolbox project.
It also contains some other files, from w3c and the Apache project, in order
to make harctooolboxbundle self contained. It can be validated without network
access.

Using the contained catalog.xml, the local versions are used instead of the
original locations.
