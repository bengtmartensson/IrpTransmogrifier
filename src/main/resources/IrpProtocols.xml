Notes for those modifying this file:

Syntax of the XML file is defined in the W3C Schema http://www.harctoolbox.org/schemas/irp-protocols.xsd
(although possibly easier to digest for machines than for humans).
This defines the XML name space irp=http://www.harctoolbox.org/irp-protocols,
using the prefix irp.

Semantics is/should be documented in the main IrpTransmogrifier documentation.

These notes are therefore to be seen as informal help to people modifying, not
as a defining document.

This document is read by IrpTransmogrifier with XInclude processing enabled, so
it is possible to use include documents according to the XInclude standard.

Usage of the attribute "c-name" in the irp:protocol element is now discouraged:
For code generation, a valid C name has to be formed from the protocol name,
which may be invalid as C identifier. IrpTransmogrifier has a rule for this
(IrpUtils.toCIdentifier(String)). The attribute allows for overriding this rule;
however, this is hardly ever necessary or even meaningful.

Semantics of some of the elements:

irp:parameter: The irp:parameter can be used to define all sort of information associated with
a particular protocol. IrpTransmogrifier ignores the ones with names it does not
use, except that it can be inquired about the values from the API. Of course, using
another program to read the file and extract the value as an XPath expression is also possible.
(For example: /irp:protocols/irp:protocol[@name="Denon"]/irp:parameter[@name="uei-executor"]/text()
extracts the text of the uei-executor for the Denon protocol).
Such a parameter contains of an arbitrary string content, or, by setting the attribute type to "xml",
an arbitrary well-formed XML fragment. For a certain name (value of the name attribute), the
element can occur multiple times.  It will be available to a reading program as a List
in Java, one list element per occurrence on the parameter with the particular name.

irp:documentation: Arbitrary documentation of the present protocol. Can contain (X)HTML markup.
More formally: it is considered as an XML document fragment. A reading user or program
can request it either as XHTML (an XML document fragment), or as text (which is
nothing but a dumb rendering of the HTML content).

irp:irp: A text string, possibly spanning several lines, containing the IRP representation
of the present protocol. Use of CDATA sections is recommended, however not required.

List of parameters recognized by IrpTransmogrifier:

prefer-over
    If a signal has multiple decodes, the present protocol is preferred over the one mentioned as prefer-over.
May be given several times. (Normally, a specialized protocol should be preferred over a more general one.)

alt_name
    Alternative name, ("alias", "synonym") for the present protocol.

reject-repeatless
    When decoding, normally the repeat sequence may match 0 times, i.e. not at all.
If this parameter is true at least one repeat must be present for a match to be recognized.
(Strictly speaking, this would have been possible to achieve by using "+" instead of "*"
for the repeat indicator, but this would have other disadvantages.)

decodable
    Setting this to false prohibits the program from trying to use this protocol for decoding.
Normally, this is only used when the IRP form makes protocol decoding impossible or not feasible.

decode-only
    Setting this to true makes the program refuse to render the protocol.
Should be used only for "protocols" that denote incomplete or otherwise flawed decodes,
for example with missing parts or non-matching checksums.

The following define protocol-private values of otherwise global parameters:

absolutetolerance
    See Numerical equality between durations. Current default: 100.0.
relativetolerance
    See Numerical equality between durations. Current default: 0.3.
frequency-tolerance
    Tolerance in Hz for frequency comparisons. Set to -1 to disable frequency check. Current default: 2000.0.
frequency-low
frequency-high
    If present, replaces the frequency-tolerance parameter.
    In this case, frequencies between frequency-low and frequency-high (inclusive) will be accepted.
minimum-leadout
    Minimal duration in micro seconds that is accepted as final duration. Current default: 20000.0.

Other parameters, both with type="xml" and type="text", are allowed,
but ignored by IrpTransmogrifier. They may be used by another program.

Additional notes on usage in RMIR:

Within an irp:protocol element, an irp:parameter with name uei-executor is read by RMIR in the decoding
of learned signals, the conversion of a set of signals to a device upgrade and import and export between
a Girr file or an IRScope ict file and a device upgrade.  There may be multiple irp:parameter entries
within the same irp:protocol element.  The content of an irp:parameter entry is either an executor
descriptor or, with its attribute type set to "xml", an XML fragment that usually includes an executor
descriptor.  XML fragments that do not include an executor descriptor affect only the display of learned
signal decodes in RMIR.  Conversion, import and export cannot be performed in these cases.

An executor descriptor is a string that identifies, for the protocol concerned, a unique executor in the
protocols.ini file of RMIR.  It also specifies how the parameter values contained in a signal decode may be
mapped to the device and command parameters of the executor for the executor to reproduce that signal.  The
syntax and semantics of an executor descriptor are specified in the document Executor Descriptor Notation:
http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=file&file_id=25672

The uei-executor entry that applies to a decode shown in the Learned Signals tab of RMIR is selected as
follows.  The entries that contain an executor descriptor are considered first, with those of type XML
taking precedence over any others.  The entry that applies is the first that is valid for the decode concerned.
An executor is valid for a decode if its executor descriptor has no qualifier or if the qualifier evaluates
true for that decode.  If there are no valid entries with an executor descriptor then one without such a
descriptor applies, if such an entry is present.

If the uei-executor has type "xml" then its content uses the XML name space
rm=https://sourceforge.net/projects/controlremote/files/RemoteMaster.
This content is a single rm:deployment element with an attribute "executor" whose value is the executor
descriptor.  An empty string is used to signify the absence of an executor descriptor.  This element may
also contain the following additional elements and will normally contain at least one of them:

rm:assignment: This may occur multiple times.  It has a single attribute "target" whose value is the name
of a parameter of the protocol, or an additional name that is defined by the assignment.  The content of
the element is an IRP bare expression that evaluates, in the context of the parameter values from the decode
and any earlier rm:assignment elements, to the value to be assigned to that name.  A definitionSpec in an
executor descriptor has this same functionality but the two methods of assignment differ in their scope.
Assignments made in a definitionSpec apply to all evaluations, which are those of the qualifier (if any)
and parameterSpec of the executor descriptor and those of the device parameters displayed in the Learned
Signals tab of RMIR.  Assignments made in an rm:assignment are evaluated after those of a definitionSpec
and apply only to the evaluation of those device parameter values displayed in RMIR.  Assigning the value
-1 to a name, either in the definitionSpec of an executor descriptor or with an rm:assignment, suppresses
 the display of that name in RMIR.  An illustration of these features is given below.

rm:translator:  Like rm:assignment, this may occur multiple times with a single attribute "target".  Its
allowed values are the names assigned after the evaluation of all rm:assignments.  It has three uses,
(a) when a name evaluates to a choice index, it allows RMIR to display the choice value rather than the
numerical choice index, (b) it allows two or more values to be combined for display, such as time=xx:yy
rather than hrs=xx, mins=yy, and (c) for names whose values are displayed as numbers, it allows an alternate
radix to be used instead of the default base 10.  For (a) the content of the element has the form
<choice name> = <choice list>, where the choice list is a list of choice values separated by vertical bars.
For (b) it again is a list separated by vertical bars, but here the first item is a format string as in
Java String.format(..) and the following items are the names whose values are the arguments of the format
string.  For (c) the content is the radix prefix, selected from the list 0b, 0q, 0 and 0x for base 2, 4,
8, 16 respectively and the value is displayed with the corresponding prefix.

rm:protocolName:  This may occur at most once.  It has no attributes and its content is a display name for
the protocol that RMIR will use in place of the value of the name attribute of the protocol.

rm:commentItem:  This may occur at most once.  It has no attributes and its content is text that RMIR
will display as a comment accompanying the decode of the signal.  Its typical use is where more than one
protocol is given the same rm:protocolName and this comment distinguishes between them.  Examples would
be two protocols differing only in frequency where the comment gives the frequency, or a relaxed version
of a protocol given an rm:protocolName that is the name of the original protocol with a comment such
as "Incomplete signal".

The NEC1-f16 protocol provides an illustration of several of these features.  It contains the entry
    <irp:parameter name="uei-executor" type="xml">
        <rm:deployment executor="011A:JP1{X=F^E^129,Y=2*X:1+X:1:7,E=-1}(;X:6:1==63)[D?0,S?0,D?1,S?1,D?2,S?2,D?3,S?3;F,??,0,Y]">
            <rm:protocolName>NEC1-Yamaha</rm:protocolName>
            <rm:translator target="Y">YStyle=NEC|Y1|Y2|Y3</rm:translator>
            <rm:assignment target="X">-1</rm:assignment>
        </rm:deployment>
    </irp:parameter>
Here F and E are command bytes resulting from the protocol decode.  The definitionSpec of the executor
descriptor defines additional names X and Y.  E is used only as an auxiliary variable in the definition of
X and does not need to be displayed, so after its use in determining X, it is assigned the value -1.
X is used only in the qualifier X:6:1==63.  If this evaluates true then RMIR displays the protocol as
NEC1-Yamaha, otherwise it passes to the next entry and displays it as NEC1-f16.  When true, the command
parameters of the 011A:JP1 executor are determined by F and Y.  For display in RMIR, Y is converted by
an rm:translator to a choice named YStyle with one of the values NEC, Y1, Y2, Y3.  X is set to -1 by
an rm:assignment to suppress its display.  This cannot be done in the definitionSpec as X is used in the
qualifier.  Note that when the qualifier evaluates true, the original value of E is completely determined
by F and Y.  When the qualifier evaluates false and the protocol is displayed as NEC1-f16, the complete
entry for the NEC1-f16 protocol shows that E is renamed for display as OBC2, by first setting OBC2 to E
and then setting E to -1 to suppress its display.

RMIR v2.10 build 2 and later support a minor enhancement to the second draft of the Executor Descriptor
Notation.  As described above, additional names defined in a definitionSpec may be used in a qualifier
as well as in a parameterSpec.  Also, the three bracketted parts of an an executor descriptor, namely
the infoSpec, definitionSpec and parameterSpec may be given in any order.  This enables a definitionSpec
to precede an infoSpec containing a qualifier if that qualifier uses the additional defined names.  This
ordering is not required but it improves the readability of the entry.

            These codes correspond to switches with code wheels, having an "House number" ranging from "A" to "P",
            in the IRP above corresponding to D=1 up to 16 for "P".
            They also have an "Address", ranging from 1 to 16, corresponding to the parameter "S" in the IRP.
            Note that e.g. Intertechno makes switches "with code wheel" and "without code wheel",
            the latter having a much larger addressing space, and unfortunately cannot be controlled by the present protocol.
            F=0 is the power off command, F=1 the power on command.
            The power on command is also used for dimming, both up and down.</p>

                <p>In some One for All remotes, for example the URC-7781,
                    the setup codes 2200,2201,...,2215 correspond to this protocol, 2200 for house "A", up to 2215 for house "P".</p>

        <blockquote>
            <div>
                This is an unusual protocol in that an 8-bit device code and 8-bit OBC are encoded
                in a 24-bit error-correcting code as the X of the IRP notation.
                This is constructed as follows.
                First two parity bits are appended to the 16 data bits to give even parity for the two sets
                of 9 bits taken alternately.
                The resulting 18-bit sequence is then treated as 6 octal digits (0-7) expressed in 3-bit binary code.
                These are then re-coded in the 3-bit Gray code
                (also called, more descriptively, the reflected-binary code) with a parity bit to give odd parity,
                so giving 6 4-bit groups treated as a single 24-bit sequence.
                The whole thing allows any single-bit error in transmission to be identified and corrected.</div>

            We have seen it used only in the UEI setup code TV/0159, which is for some TVs brand named Fisher, Sanyo and Sears.
            It is not likely that any other code set uses this protocol.
            So if you get a correct decode of pid-0083 you probably have a TV that can be controlled by the TV/0159 setup code.

        <irp:documentation xml:space="preserve">Pioneer is distinguished from <a href="#NEC2">NEC2</a> only by frequency.
            So if your learning system does not learn frequency accurately, it won't accurately distinguish Pioneer from NEC2.
            All Pioneer signals should have a device number in the range 160 to 175 and no subdevice.
            No NEC2 signal should fit those rules.
            So you usually can determine whether the decision (by frequency) was wrong by checking the device numbers.

            Many Pioneer commands are sent as combinations of two different Pioneer signals, see <a href="#Pioneer.Mix">Pioneer-Mix</a>.
