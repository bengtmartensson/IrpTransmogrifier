The files in this directory are not part of IrpTransmogrifier proper. They are
invoked on the XML file generated by irptransmogrifier ... code --target xml ...
IrpTransmogrifier does not come with am XSLT engine, so the user has to
install and invoke it himself. The Makefile 
https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrpTransmogrifier/blob/master/tools/Makefile
may be useful.

Note that they may require an XSLT2 processor, unfortunately ruling out all the
standard ones (Xalan, xsltproc, msxml,...). There is presently only one such
freely available, Saxon home edition:
